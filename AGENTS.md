# Repository instructions

## Java conventions

- Import Java types instead of using fully qualified class names in code.
- Use PascalCase for Java class names. Preserve the existing package roots.

## React conventions

- Use PascalCase for React component names. Match the existing component filename convention.
- Use kebab-case for new hook and utility filenames, unless this repository documents another convention.
- Use stable domain identities as React keys. Do not use array indexes as keys.
- Use an existing `generateN` helper or stable placeholder IDs for fixed skeleton slots.
- Keep page structure, headings, navigation, labels, and independent content mounted while data loads.
- Show skeletons only for unresolved values, rows, and permission-dependent actions. Do not block a page on its slowest query.

## Tailwind spacing

- Use `gap-*` utilities for spacing between elements. Do not use `space-*` utilities.

## shadcn/ui

- For shadcn/ui work, use the `shadcn` skill and component documentation.
- Compose existing shadcn/ui components before writing custom primitives. Use `Field`, `InputGroup`, and `Item` where appropriate.
- Fix application consumers before changing `components/ui`. Change a shared primitive only for a demonstrated component defect.

## Design skills

- For visual design work, use `frontend-design` and `uncodixfy`.
